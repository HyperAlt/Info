You might be asking:
Why did you guys change your profile?

Well the simple answer is..
Rebranding, we are doing a rebrand where every project (not including Voxels) are going to be renamed
for example: JitterCode -> Warmdrop, and so on (You can read it all at "CHANGES-OF-ProjectName.md".
and we want to rebrand our logo further. So if you want to look at our logo clearly. just go to "logo-main.png (Profile Pic) or logo-transparent.png."
